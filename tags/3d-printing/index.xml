      <description>Recently NASA has made the first powered flight on Mars. They have deployed a drone called Ingenuity costing about $85 million. The helicopter was able to fly on about ten meters altitude (as of May, 7) over the surface of the Red Planet.
Coincidently, I have also built a flying drone. This looked like a good challenge and an opportunity to learn about unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).
Here is what I learned.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here is a step by step tutorial on how to design objects for 3D printing using
OpenSCAD. We illustrate the design process by creating a micro quadcopter
frame. This small drone bears the code name of Beatle-1.  After following the
tutorial you will be able to conceive your own designs for 3D printing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
