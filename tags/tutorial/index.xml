      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here is a step by step tutorial on how to design objects for 3D printing using
OpenSCAD. We illustrate the design process by creating a micro quadcopter
frame. This small drone bears the code name of Beatle-1.  After following the
tutorial you will be able to conceive your own designs for 3D printing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Day 5: Convolutional Neural Networks Tutorial</title>

      <description>Today we will talk about one of the most important deep learning architectures, the &amp;quot;master algorithm&amp;quot; in computer vision. That is how Fran√ßois Chollet, author of Keras, calls convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Convolutional network is an architecture that, like other artificial neural networks, has a neuron as its core building block. It is also differentiable, so the network is conveniently trained via backpropagation. The distinctive feature of CNNs, however, is the connection topology, resulting in sparsely connected convolutional layers with neurons sharing their weights.</description>
