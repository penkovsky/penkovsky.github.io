    <div class="article-style">
      
      Today we will talk about one of the most important deep learning architectures, the &quot;master algorithm&quot; in computer vision. That is how François Chollet, author of Keras, calls convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Convolutional network is an architecture that, like other artificial neural networks, has a neuron as its core building block. It is also differentiable, so the network is conveniently trained via backpropagation. The distinctive feature of CNNs, however, is the connection topology, resulting in sparsely connected convolutional layers with neurons sharing their weights.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      The advent of deep learning has substantially accelerated machine learning development during the last decade impacting computer vision, natural language processing, and other domains. However, those deep learning implementations require almost two orders of magnitude more power compared to the human brain, requiring thus constant connection to dedicated data centers. With new memories available, emerging Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) are promising to reduce the energy impact of the forthcoming machine learning hardware generation, enabling machine learning on the edge devices and avoiding data transfer over the network.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      Which purpose do neural networks serve for? Neural networks are learnable models. Their ultimate goal is to approach or even surpass human cognitive abilities. As Richard Sutton puts it, 'The biggest lesson that can be read from 70 years of AI research is that general methods that leverage computation are ultimately the most effective'. In his essay, Sutton argues that only models without encoded human-knowledge can outperform human-centeric approaches. Indeed, neural networks are general enough and they leverage computation.

      Now that we have seen how neural networks work, we realize that understanding of the gradients flow is essential for survival. Therefore, we will revise our strategy on the lowest level. However, as neural networks become more complicated, calculation of gradients by hand becomes a murky business. Yet, fear not young padawan, there is a way out! I am very excited that today we will finally get acquainted with automatic differentiation, an essential tool in your deep learning arsenal.

    <h2><a href="https://penkovsky.com/neural-networks/day2/">Day 2: What Do Hidden Layers Do?</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      In the previous article, we have introduced the concept of learning in a single-layer neural network. Today, we will learn about the benefits of multi-layer neural networks, how to properly design and train them.
Sometimes I discuss neural networks with students who have just started discovering machine learning techniques:
&quot;I have built a handwritten digits recognition network. But my accuracy is only Y.&quot;
&quot;It seems to be much less than state-of-the-art&quot;, I contemplate.

    <h2><a href="https://penkovsky.com/neural-networks/day1/">Day 1: Learning Neural Networks The Hard Way</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      Neural networks is a topic that recurrently appears throughout my life. Once, when I was a BSc student, I got obsessed with the idea to build an &quot;intelligent&quot; machine1. I spent a couple of sleepless nights thinking. I read a few essays shedding some light on this philosophical subject, among which the most prominent, perhaps, stand Marvin Minsky's writings2. As a result, I came across the neural networks idea. It was 2010, and deep learning was not nearly as popular as it is now3.
