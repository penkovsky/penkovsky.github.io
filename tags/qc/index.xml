      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I first learned about quantum computing, I thought it will be a long time
before we actually see a quantum computer. Later, in 2019, I attended a
brilliant talk by Alain Aspect who is known for his
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_test&#34;&gt;experiments&lt;/a&gt; on Bell&#39;s theorem.
The very same year, Google &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1666-5&#34;&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt;
to have achieved quantum supremacy. These events made me realize that quantum
computing is not just a theoretical concept. The idea that
sparked my interest. I wanted to understand how is it even possible
that the result does not exist until we measure it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
