      <description>DDE package is a fast library written in Haskell that I have extracted after my PhD. Previously, my work involved a lot dynamical systems described by DDEs. I kept switching between several tools, still I had no fast and flexible library. So here is one now.
Below is an example of a dual-delay model taken from a recent publication. It is given by the following delay differential equation:
$$ \varepsilon \frac{dx(t)}{dt}+x(t)+\delta\cdot\intop_{t_{0}}^{t}x(\xi)d\xi = (1-\gamma)f\left(x_{\tau_{1}}\right)+\gamma f\left(x_{\tau_{2}}\right), $$</description>
