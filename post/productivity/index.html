    <div class="article-style" itemprop="articleBody">
      <p>Many articles have been written on the topic. And yet I am writing another one, as a reminder.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="#create-a-lot-of-free-space">Create a lot of free space</a></p></li>

<li><p><a href="#generate-many-ideas">Generate many ideas</a></p></li>

<li><p><a href="#bring-some-ideas-to-the-very-end">Bring some ideas to the very end</a></p></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="create-a-lot-of-free-space">Create A Lot Of Free Space</h2>

<p>Common sense suggests that a very busy schedule has its opportunity cost. And
the associated cost is not even reduced creativity. It is reduced productivity.
Here is how I realized that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><big>The act of creating space is also an act of power and of freedom of
choice.</big></p>
</blockquote>

<p>A few years ago I started a side project which has substantially altered my
schedule. During my PhD and later years, I was accustomed to finishing my
working day after 8pm. I enjoyed my work, or so I thought. However, because of
the new side project I was forced to finish my day job by 5pm. This way I
returned home earlier and had a few hours to spend on my extra project. To my
surprise, I was not simply doing “two jobs”. (The right term here is
<em>interleaving</em>.) This new schedule boosted my enthusiasm. And enthusiasm in it’s
turn helped to produce better results on the first job. My ideas became also
more diverse. And I felt that the days became more meaningful overall.</p>

<p>One way to look at that experience is to guess that in fact I have become
busier. Well, I cannot deny that I had more responsibilities by then. The other
way of thinking is that I have created a time slot, a free space, which was
beneficial to do something new.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><big>Being lucky is about being alert to the unexpected.</big><br>
(Psyche journal)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The act of creating space is also an act of power and of freedom of choice. From
this perspective, being “lucky” is nourished by that freedom. Call it
<em>serendipity</em> if you will. Psyche journal <a href="https://psyche.co/guides/how-to-open-up-to-serendipity-and-create-your-own-luck">article</a><sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:fn-luck"><a href="#fn:fn-luck">1</a></sup> suggests
that being lucky is about being alert to the unexpected. In a social experiment,
the “lucky” person finds a banknote on a pavement, comes inside a nearby coffee
shop, and starts a conversation with a random visitor in there. And that random
person happens to be a business man, a new connection. Whereas the “unlucky”
person fails to accomplish any of those. My impression is that the “unlucky”
person in the experiment does not allow themself for any “free” space in any
possible meaning such as time, money, personal freedom, etc.</p>

<p>Speaking of money. Two years before the 2020 pandemic (and that also implies,
before the above article appeared in Psyche journal), I took an airplane when
coming from a conference. I cannot call myself a spender. I am typically careful
with money, this is my upbringing. However, that time I decided to “upgrade” the
airplane ticket. Just for the sake of change. And guess what? I am sitting in
the “premium economy” class (not even some fancy “business class”) next to a VP
of some quite large company (more than 3000 employees). Honestly, I didn’t care
about the position of the person. What I was actually impressed about was how
quick was their brain to find analogies in many linguistic questions. And they
gave some great advice about creating a start-up.</p>

<h2 id="generate-many-ideas">Generate Many Ideas</h2>

<p>This one seems so obvious. Yet to me, it was not obvious at all. If you are like
me, then you may pick some ideas from Originals: How Non-Conformists Move the
World by Adam Grant<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:fn-adam-grant"><a href="#fn:fn-adam-grant">2</a></sup>. The author argues that to increase the
“chance of success”, one has to generate many ideas. The less obvious
consequence perhaps is that the famous pieces of art, the most famous inventions
and so on are only very few known contributions of their inventors. The tip of
the ideas iceberg.</p>

<p>If you think you may not enjoy the book, then as a one-sentence summary I will
adapt this one, from Chapter 2: “the rule is that you need to generate at least
twenty-five ideas to strike gold“. I just opened the latest bookmark and it
happened to be this one. Serendipity.</p>

<p>Critics (those who won’t read) will ask, <em>why twenty-five</em>? Please read carefully, “at least twenty-five”. Twenty-six. Forty. You name it.</p>

<p>And one more thing, Adam Grant provides a table of odds of Nobel Prize winning for those scientists that indulge in artistic hobbies. Want to guess? Yes, the odds are higher for those artistically-inclined scientists. Which reinforces the “create a lot of free space” guideline. For example, Richard Feynman won a Nobel prize in physics in 1965. If you knew that fact then you probably know that he also enjoyed playing bongos. An artistic hobby is a free space for thinking.
Similarly, Cal Newport in his book Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World
insists on the necessity of creating dedicated time slots. This is the time when you are not distracted by anything else.
And this is when you have space to think. And to seed new ideas.</p>

<h2 id="bring-some-ideas-to-the-very-end">Bring Some Ideas To The Very End</h2>

<p>Speaking about the artistic side of Feynman. He used to consider himself as someone not being able to draw. <em>I am that kind of person, too</em>, some readers may think. Did you know that at some point in his life, Feynman was taught to draw? Did you also know that this led to Feynman's solo art exhibition<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:fn-feynman-bio"><a href="#fn:fn-feynman-bio">3</a></sup> under his proper pseudonym?</p>

<p>The last point I want to make here. By generating at least twenty-five ideas for
a subject of choice, you will have to be quite selective. It is almost sure that
you will not have time to implement all of them to fruition. Yet very probably
the only way to benefit is to bring one of these ideas to completion. Whether
your attempt fails or not, how can you know if the idea was worth it if you haven't invested your time in it? Finally, the learning experience by writing a few
equations on a figurative black board is not the same as going into the details
of making a real-life experiment. And making an experiment is not the same as
making a working prototype. Which itself does not require the same amount of
effort as scaling this up and making a product that may (or may not) change the
world.</p>

<h2 id="modus-operandi">Modus Operandi</h2>

<p>Are there any guidelines how to implement the above in everyday life? Here are
a few considerations that I find useful.</p>

<p>Mark Mortier from 2Circle says that Wellbeing = Productivity. This is quite
self-explanatory. Get back to the basics. Sleep well, eat well, exercise. Once
you've got these all right, start thinking about the rest.
As they say, before improving the world, start with yourself.</p>

<p>James Clear (the author of Atomic Habits) came up with the following
observation: In the long-run, <a href="https://jamesclear.com/3-2-1/may-12-2022">prioritization beats
efficiency</a>. So here is a simple
guideline that helps me in everyday work (I apologize for not remembering the
original source of the idea): There are three modes: <em>Producing</em> (creative
mode), <em>Networking</em> (communicating), and <em>Consuming</em> (e.g. learning, watching,
reading). <em>Networking</em> and <em>Consuming</em> can be combined. However, <em>Producing</em> can
only be done well when not distracted by the other two modes. Don't let any
meetings distract you from producing whatever you are producing (strategic
planning, writing reports, coding, painting, etc.). Thereby I aim at starting
the day in the <em>Creative</em> mode, before any meetings, discussions, emails or
any other communication (<em>Networking</em> mode).</p>
